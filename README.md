# Rectangle
Implement the Rectangle class by editing the provided file. **You should not need to edit the Main file, which is meant to help test your program.**

It should have two fields (variables): width and height.

It should also have two methods with no parameters:
* calculateArea() returns the area calculated from `this.width` and `this.height`
* calculatePerimeter() returns the perimeter

## Bonus
Implement a method `public fitsInside(Rectangle otherRect)` method that returns true if the rectangle would fit inside `otherRect`.
